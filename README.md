# Kolme React

This repository contains the `kolme-react` project created with Vite and React 18. It uses React Router v6, Axios, and Bootstrap 5.

The app includes authentication with the Context API, a global layout (header, sidebar, footer), protected routes, and example pages such as a dashboard and employee list. Components are written as functional components with hooks and use Bootstrap icons for UI elements.

## Setup

1. Install Node.js (latest LTS).
2. Run `npm install` inside the `kolme-react` folder to install dependencies.
3. Start the dev server with `npm start`.
